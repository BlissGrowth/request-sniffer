- üìä **Comprehensive Data Capture** - Full request/response headers, bodies, and timing
- üñ•Ô∏è **Interactive Popup Interface** - Browse captured requests with detailed inspection modal
- üåê **Webhook Integration** - Send captured data to external endpoints via POST requests
- üîß **URL Resolution** - Properly handles both relative and absolute URLs
- ‚ö° **Manifest V3 Compatible** - Modern Chrome extension architecture

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Google Chrome browser
- Chrome Developer Mode enabled

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:BlissGrowth/request-sniffer.git
   cd request-sniffer
   ```

2. **Install in Chrome**
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)
   - Click "Load unpacked" button
   - Select the `request-sniffer` directory
   - The extension should appear in your Chrome toolbar

## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. **Click the extension** in your Chrome toolbar to open the popup
2. **Enable monitoring** by toggling the "Enable Monitoring" switch
3. **Set URL pattern** (regex) to match the requests you want to capture
   - Example: `.*api.*` captures all URLs containing "api"
   - Example: `^https://api\\.example\\.com/` captures specific API domain
4. **Optional: Set reporting URL** to send captured data to a webhook endpoint

### URL Pattern Examples

| Pattern | Description | Matches |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `.*` | All requests | Everything |
| `.*api.*` | Contains "api" | `https://example.com/api/users`, `/api/data` |
| `^https://api\\.` | Starts with "https://api." | `https://api.github.com/user` |
| `\\.json$` | Ends with ".json" | `https://example.com/data.json` |
| `/users/\\d+` | User ID endpoints | `/users/123`, `/users/456` |

### Viewing Captured Requests

1. **Request List**: All captured requests appear in the popup with:
   - üü¢ Green circle: Successful requests (2xx status)
   - üü† Orange circle: Redirects (3xx status) 
   - üî¥ Red circle: Client/server errors (4xx, 5xx status)
   - ‚ö™ Gray circle: Unknown/pending status

2. **Request Details**: Click any request to view:
   - **Request Headers** - All headers sent with the request
   - **Request Body** - POST data, JSON payloads, form data
   - **Response Headers** - Server response headers  
   - **Response Body** - JSON responses, HTML content, etc.

3. **Clear History**: Use "Clear All" button to remove all captured requests

### Webhook Integration

Configure a reporting URL to automatically send captured request data to external systems:

1. **Set Reporting URL** in the popup (e.g., `https://your-server.com/webhook`)
2. **Each captured request** will be POST'd as JSON to this endpoint
3. **Payload structure**:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/users",
  "baseUrl": "https://api.example.com", 
  "path": "/users",
  "isRelative": false,
  "originalUrl": "/users",
  "requestHeaders": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer token123"
  },
  "requestBody": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  "responseHeaders": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "responseBody": {
    "id": 123,
    "status": "created"
  },
  "statusCode": 201,
  "statusText": "Created",
  "responseTime": 245,
  "capturedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
  "tabUrl": "https://myapp.com/dashboard",
  "tabId": 123456
}
```

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Manifest V3** - Uses modern Chrome extension architecture
- **Dual Content Scripts** - ISOLATED world for Chrome APIs, MAIN world for network interception  
- **Cross-World Messaging** - `window.postMessage()` for reliable communication
- **Service Worker** - Background script manages settings and webhook reporting

### URL Resolution

The extension properly resolves relative URLs:
- Relative path `/api/users` on page `https://app.com/dashboard` becomes `https://app.com/api/users`
- Pattern matching always works against the full resolved URL
- Original URL preserved for debugging purposes

### Request Data Structure

Each captured request includes:
- `url` - Complete resolved URL (used for pattern matching)
- `baseUrl` - Protocol + domain + port
- `path` - Pathname + search parameters + hash
- `isRelative` - Boolean indicating if original request was relative
- `originalUrl` - Exact URL string as provided in the request
- Complete headers, bodies, timing, and response data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Extension not capturing requests:**
- Ensure "Enable Monitoring" is toggled on
- Check URL pattern matches the requests you want to capture
- Look for debug logs in browser console (`F12`)
- Verify the target page is making network requests

**Settings not updating:**
- Refresh the target webpage after changing settings
- Check background script console for error messages
- Ensure extension has necessary permissions

**Webhook not working:**
- Verify reporting URL is accessible and accepts POST requests
- Check background script console for HTTP error messages
- Ensure webhook endpoint accepts `application/json` content type

### Debug Logs

Enable detailed logging by:
1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find Request Sniffer extension
3. Click "service worker" to open background script console
4. Look for logs prefixed with `üîç` for extension-specific messages
